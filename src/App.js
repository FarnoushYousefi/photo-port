//A single-page application, or SPA, is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current webpage, in place of the default method of the browser loading entirely new pages. This approach allows for a more fluid UI because the page doesn't have to be reloaded each time.React allows for conditional rendering and can replace a portion of the webpage based on the user's selection.
//Notice the <> and </> that wrap the Gallery and About components. Can you imagine what these are and what they might be for? They are called React fragmentsâ€”a shorthand abbreviation for <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>.
//They're a useful tool in React to allow multiple elements to be grouped together. Although in JSX you can only return a single parent element, this rule can be satisfied by wrapping the children components in a React fragment.
